The task for the Web development and designing internship was to accomplish three tasks of any given level (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3), as convenient, in order to successfully finish the internship. I selected level 2 activities, which comprised a calculator, a memorial or a tribute page, and a straightforward to-do web application. This internship lasted for four weeks. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to effectively finish all three activities of the level 2 projects.

Task 1: Calculator
