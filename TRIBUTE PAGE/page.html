      <h1>About</h1>
      <p id="p1"><img src="d7.jpg" class="im3"> <strong>Diana</strong>  was raised nearby the royal family 
        on their Sandringham home and was born into the British nobility. While working as a nursery teacher's 
        assistant in 1981, she got engaged to the Prince of Wales, Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son.
        She became the Princess of Wales after their 1981 wedding, which was held at St. Paul's 
        Cathedral and got a warm reception from the general public. 
        William and Harry, the couple's two sons, were then second and third 
        in line for the British throne.
        Diana and Charles' marriage suffered as a result of their compatibility issues and adulterous activities.
        They split up in 1992, not long after their relationship's demise became widely known.
        Their marital problems were publicly reported.
        Princess Diana struggled with depression, bulimia, and attempted suicide once after she and Prince Charles got divorced. 
        That was advantageous for Princess Diana. She wished to begin aiding other ladies who were experiencing issues similar to her own.
        She also began to focus more on her sons and less on the media.</p>

        <p id="p2"><img src="d13.jpg" class="im1" >Diana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world.
          Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: "[Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.
          he was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, it was something that really mattered to her.
          Elements of her fashion rapidly became trends. She forgoed certain traditions, such as wearing gloves during engagements,
          and sought to create a wardrobe that helped her to connect with the public. According to Donatella Versace who worked closely
          with Diana alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her marital separation. 
          Her style subsequently grew bolder and more businesslike, featuring structured skirt suits, sculptural gowns, and neutral tones designed
          to reflect attention toward her charity work. 
          Her iconic outfits include a cocktail dress by Christina Stambolian, commonly known as the <strong>"Revenge dress"</strong> , 
          which she wore after Charles's admission of adultery, as well as an evening gown by Victor Edelstein that she wore to a reception at the 
          White House and later became known as the "Travolta dress.
          People cited her as one of the all-time most beautiful women.</p>

        <h1>Philanthrophy</h1>
        <p id="p3"> <img src="d10.jpg" class="im2"> Princess Diana stood out from previous rulers in part because she made use
          of her regal position to advance the interests of others in Britain. She began by demonstrating that she wasn't
          simply another princess and didn't take advantage of her position of royalty for her own gain. When she discussed her depression,
          she demonstrated that she was just like everyone else. The first step was to be frank about her troubles.
          Princess Diana participated in and supported more than 100 charities all over the world. 
          The <strong> Diana, Princess of Wales Fund</strong> was one of her causes. Princess Diana supported the care of the terminally ill,
          and that amusement helped. Additionally, she contributed to the hospice cause ("Remembering the People's Princess").
          By touring landmine sites, Princess Diana contributed to the opposition against landmines and accelerated Britain's modernization.
          Diana contributed to increasing public awareness of AIDS and eating disorders. She contributed significantly to the National AIDS Trust.
          <strong>The National AIDS Trust</strong>  assists in gathering knowledge, educating the public, and providing care for those who have HIV/AIDS.
          She was one of the first well-known persons to actively get involved with AIDS at the time, and she linked hands with a 
          boy who had AIDS on television to make a point about the disease. She also assisted children with cancer, leprosy, 
          and other illnesses in addition to AIDS. Princess Diana also contributed to the homeless and underprivileged.</p>

        <h1>Death</h1>
        <p id="p4"> <img src="d12.jpg" class="im4"> The <strong>“People’s Princess” </strong> was killed in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997.
          It's been exactly 25 years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. But her legacy of activism and charity lives on.
          Diana died at age 36 of injuries sustained in a car crash in Paris, which also killed her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.
          Everyone was grieved by the death of Princess Diana. For her funeral, her family organised a large ceremony. Even after she passed away,
          her charitable deeds were still remembered. They organised an exhibition, and it is still on display at the Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art. 
          All throughout the world, people travel to view her garments and remember her. She had a big impact on many people, and I doubt she'll ever be forgotten.
          Everyone who knew and interacted with Princess Diana felt a strong connection to her. People discussed all of their recollections of her when she passed away.
          She was a kind person who, based on what others had to say about her, appeared to make an effort to treat everyone nicely. <br>
